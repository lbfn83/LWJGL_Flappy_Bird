# LWJGL_Flappy_Bird

This is a tweaked version of Flappy Bird made for desktop platforms, which was originally created for a video tutorial on YouTube where Cherno demonstrates how to make this game from scratch, in about 3 hours including short explanations of what is being typed, and why. <br /><br />
  You can find the Youtube video [here](http://youtu.be/527bR2JHSR0). <br />
